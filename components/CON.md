    Unless you add written notice
    of different license terms
    to specific work,

This exception permits contributions under different, but
compatible, license terms.

For example, B may propose adding code to C's project that A
published under an MIT license. The MIT License is probably
compatible with the project. But B almost certainly can't
relicense A's work.

    you must license work
    on the software
    that you send
    to any contributor
    as contributions
    under this license.
