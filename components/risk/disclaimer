This software comes "as is".

# UCC 2-316(3)(a):
#
#   unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all
#   implied warranties are excluded by expressions like
#   "as is", "with all faults" or other language which in
#   common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the
#   exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no
#   implied warranty
#

# Quote "as is", because they're magic legal words.

No contributor makes any warranty.
